# Customer Statement of Requirements
The motivation for this project came from playing games and wanting to create an experience that allows players to feel a sense of achievement. The problem is making a project that has an objective that is both enticing and challenging. The objective needs to be appealing enough to keep the player engaged, but complex enough so that the player feels a sense of accomplishment when progressing in the game. This also includes: making this project without bugs. The solution to keeping the player engaged will be achieved through appealing visual themes and simple, yet effective, design of player control. This, combined with the reasonable difficulty of the enemies adds a layer of complexity that makes the game satisfying to beat. Implementation of rigorous game testing proved efficient in eliminating most, if not all, bugs that occured in the development of the game. One of the specific titles that inspired this project is The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Some of the features implemented from it: the player’s health is represented by hearts and the player is able to attack enemies with melee or ranged attacks.
